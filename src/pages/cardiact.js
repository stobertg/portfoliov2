                <p>CardiAct is a mobile application designed to reduce response time for victims of cardiac arrest by crowdsourcing assistance from CPR certified individuals near a victim during an emergency. Pairing the application with a supported physical heart monitor will allow it to keep track of a userâ€™s heart rate and detect any abnormalities. The app can even request help automatically if the victim is unresponsive.</p>
                <p>The application would be used by both the potential victims, and the potential responders. When a user is in need of emergency assistance, they can use the app to request help and responders within a 2 mile radius receives an alert with the victims name, address and estimated time it would take to reach them.</p>
